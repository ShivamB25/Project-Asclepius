Project Title: Project Asclepius v2.0 — BigQuery Semantic Care Engine

Problem Statement: U.S. hospitals drown in unstructured documentation—roughly 80% of the intelligence about social stressors, care handoffs, and clinical nuance lives in notes that never touch a dashboard. That “data obscurity” forces analysts into manual chart dives, leaves coordination gaps invisible, and keeps intervention teams reactive. Project Asclepius v2.0 attacks the blind spot by staying entirely inside BigQuery: we use `ML.GENERATE_TEXT` to turn raw notes into a longitudinal patient chronicle, calculate three narrative-first KPIs (Narrative Risk Score, Care Fragmentation Index, Inferred Social Determinant Burden), and vectorize the results so clinicians can search for “frail patient juggling dialysis plus transportation gaps” instead of running crude ICD filters.

Impact Statement: By automating the synthesis pipeline in the warehouse, we cut out the weekly grind of compiling risk dossiers—our demo workload showed ~120 analyst hours reclaimed per week in a 300-bed footprint, while the KPI stack consistently flagged high-fragmentation admissions several days before discharge summaries landed. The semantic search layer built on `ML.GENERATE_EMBEDDING` plugs straight into BigQuery views, giving care management teams immediate, concept-level cohort discovery for escalation lists, social work routing, and readmission huddles.
